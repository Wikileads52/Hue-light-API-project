# Hue-light-API-project
A little python project to better my understanding of API calls. This project is a way to broaden my understanding of API, coding with API.
To use this code the user has to create a .env file in the same folder ontaining the Hue bridge ip, the user Hue username, the instructions to get those can be found be following this hue official guide at: https://developers.meethue.com/develop/hue-api-v2/getting-started/
The user also has to pip install the libraries present in the requirement.txt file.
This project is still being developped, and features will be added in the future like a connection with other APIs like the OpenWeatherMap API to quickly get visual signals of what the weather will be like during the day.
Later on I will add to this repo my own API that I will create with Fast-API to deepen even more my understanding of APIs.
